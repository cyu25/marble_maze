# -Wall enables all warnings about constructions that some users consider questionable
#  and are easily avoided 
# -O optimizes for code size and execution time without increasing compilation time; 
# -Os optimizes only for code size
# -DF_CPU passes the clock speed down to units that need it, e.g., delay functions
