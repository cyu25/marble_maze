In this project, a full control system for a marble maze was designed. This maze included:
1. on-off control. The maze should not do anything until a button is pressed
2. Smooth control of the maze platform using the joystick.
3. The seven-seg display was used.
4. Use of the “Start” and “Finish” sensors to indicate game state
5. The on board LEDs to indicate game state, blink red just before the game starts, green when it’s time to move.
